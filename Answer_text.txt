The Old Arbat is a picturesque pedestrian street in Moscow, running west from Arbat Square (which is part of the Boulevard Ring) towards Smolenskaya Square (which is part of the Garden Ring)
The first mention of the Arbat was in 1493 as a road leading from the Moscow Kremlin to Smolensk
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the neighbourhood was graced with elegant churches, notably the one featured in Vasily Polenov's celebrated painting A Courtyard in Moscow (1879)
In the 18th century, the Arbat came to be regarded by the Russian nobility as the most prestigious living area in Moscow
Alexander Pushkin lodged in one of its mansions for a short time, and there is a statue of him and his wife, Natalie, in front of this house
In the 20th century, the street succumbed to limited renovations in the Art Nouveau and Constructivist styles
The street's confluence with the Garden Ring was marked with a flamboyant wedding-cake skyscraper of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Simultaneously, most of the Arbat's churches were demolished, including that of St Nicholas, regarded as one of the finest examples of Godunov style
It has several notable statues, including one to Princess Turandot in front of the Vakhtangov Theatre and another to Soviet-era folk singer, bard, and poet, Bulat Okudzhava, who wrote several poignant songs about the Arbat
To this day, Russian youth frequently gather on the Arbat to play the songs of Tsoi and other Russian songwriters
